Hello,

I am Haytam Elyoussfi, a PhD candidate in GeoAI and Geospatial Big Data at the [Center for Remote Sensing Applications (CRSA)](https://crsa.um6p.ma/home){:target="_blank"} within the College of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences (CAES) at [Mohammed VI Polytechnic University (UM6P)](https://um6p.ma/){:target="_blank"}, Morocco.

My PhD thesis is titled: "Towards a Water Decision Support System: Integrating Geospatial Big Data and AI Techniques," supervised by [Prof. Abdelghani CHEHBOUNI](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/A-Chehbouni){:target="_blank"} and Co-supervised by Prof. Abdelghani BOUDHAR and Prof. Salwa BELAQZIZ. This research is part of the project on Monitoring and Quantifying Snowmelt Contribution for Moroccan Water Management Strategies in the Context of Climate Change [(MorSnow Project)](https://crsa.um6p.ma/projects/Monitoring-and-Quantifying-Snowmelt-contribution-for-Moroccan-Water-Management-strategies-in-the-context-of-Climate-Change--1st-Phase-(MorSnow-1)/?id=6033bc14f098326b3be26473){:target="_blank"}. 

I am currently a Visiting Researcher at the [Swiss Data Science Center](https://www.datascience.ch/){:target="_blank"}, [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/de.html){:target="_blank"} working with [Dr. Michele Volpi](https://www.datascience.ch/people/michele-volpi){:target="_blank"} on applying AI and data-driven approaches to Earth Observation and environmental monitoring.

Previously, I completed a research visit at at [KU Leuven](https://ees.kuleuven.be/en/bwb/research/land-surface-data-assimilation){:target="_blank"}, within the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, specifically in the Land Surface Remote Sensing, Modeling and Data Assimilation Group in Belgium. My visit is under the supervision of [Dr. Gabrielle De Lannoy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IeM7opcAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"}.

My research interests lie at the intersection of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Remote Sensing, and Geospatial Big Data, with a focus on developing AI-powered solutions for sustainable water and environmental management.

In parallel, I also have the privilege of coordinating the [DigitalHub Network Community](https://www.linkedin.com/company/digitalhub-network/mycompany/?viewAsMember=true){:target="_blank"}, a platform dedicated to enhancing the digital skills and capabilities of youth and professionals across Morocco and Africa.
